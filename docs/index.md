# About me

![Jean Nassar (Obligatory photo)](/assets/images/jean.png){: style="width:200px;border-radius: 50%", align="left"}

Hello! I'm Jean Nassar, and I'm a senior Python and robotics expert with more than 10 years of multidisciplinary experience.

I am currently looking for a [[#hire-me|new full-time opportunity]] in Belgium starting from 1 September 2023.

I have been living in Belgium since 2018, and have worked in multiple fields,
including [[work#industrial-automation-engineer-kapernikov|industrial automation]],
[[work#senior-python-developer-yieldsio|data science]], and [[work#senior-software-engineer-adimian|web development]].

As a senior engineer of almost 4 years,
I have [[mentoring|mentored colleagues]] in software development best practices and nurtured their Python skills.
I have received praise for my patience and ability to explain complex topics effectively.

I completed my [[kyoto|Masters program]] with the
[Mechatronics lab]{{ urls.edu.matsuno }} at Kyoto University in Japan.
There, I focused on [[projects|human-robot interaction]],
with projects such as:

- [[spirit|SPIRIT]], a third-person view for monocular drones
- [[yozakura|Yozakura]], a teleoperated robot for the Rescue League at the RoboCup Japan Open
- [[myo|Gestural Control of Robots]], infrastructure for controlling robots with gestures and other modalities


I did my [[waterloo|Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Honours Mechatronics Engineering]]
at the University of Waterloo in Canada, including [[coop|six co-operative education terms]] at various companies around the world.

I enjoy working on challenging problems that require me to think outside the box, and exploring new frontiers in technology.
This is also reflected in my hobbies, which include
learning new [[skills]] and [[skills#languages|languages]], automating processes, hiking, and stargazing.

Please see [[cv|my CV]] or my [PDF résumé]{{ urls.cv.pdf }} for more details about my experience.
