Welcome to my site, and thanks for the visit!

My name is Jean Nassar.
I'm a season Python and robotics expert, and I am currently looking for a new challenge.

Since graduating, I have [worked](cv/work_experience) primarily as a software engineer, primarily in Belgium.
As a holder of the EU Blue Card, I'm equipped to embark on new professional endeavours
immediately upon fulfillment of employment and visa prerequisites.

I bring to the table seven enriching years of industry experience that spans across continents and disciplines.
My professional journey started with a [Bachelors degree in Honours Mechatronics Engineering](cv/education/uwaterloo) at the University of Waterloo.
As a student there, I also did [six co-op terms](cv/work_experience/coop) at various companies around the world.
I then further honed my expertise by completing a [Masters program](cv/education/kyoto-u) with the [Mechatronics lab](http://www.mechatronics.me.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.php?ml_lang=en) at Kyoto University.

I am also a [private tutor](cv/teaching_experience) for many subjects, including Python, robotics, prompt engineering, and Japanese.

I enjoy working on challenging problems that require me to think outside the box.
This is also reflected in my hobbies, which include
[learning languages](cv/languages), automating things around me, hiking and exploration, and learning many new skills.
I love space, and even applied to become an astronaut in 2016.
