# About me

![Jean Nassar (Obligatory photo)](assets/images/jean.png){: style="width:200px;border-radius: 50%", align="left"}

Hello! I'm Jean Nassar, and I'm a senior Python and robotics expert with more than 10 years of experience that spans continents and disciplines.

I am currently looking for [a new full-time opportunity](#hire-me) in Belgium starting on 1 September 2023.

I have been living in Belgium since 2018, and have worked in multiple fields,
including [data science](cv/work/sentiance), [industrial automation](cv/work/kapernikov), [finance](cv/work/yields), and [web development](cv/work/adimian).
As a senior engineer for almost 4 years, I have [mentored coworkers](cv/mentoring) in Python and software development best practices.

I completed my [Masters program](cv/education/kyoto) with the
[Mechatronics lab]{{ urls.edu.matsuno }} at Kyoto University in Japan.
There, I focused on [human-robot interaction](cv/projects),
with projects such as:

- [Spirit](cv/projects/spirit), a third-person view for monocular drones
- [Yozakura](cv/projects/yozakura), a teleoperated robot for the Rescue League at the RoboCup Japan Open
- [Gestural Control of Robots](cv/projects/myo), infrastructure for controlling robots with gestures and other modalities


I did my [Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Honours Mechatronics Engineering](cv/education/waterloo)
at the University of Waterloo, including [six co-operative education terms](cv/work/coop) at various companies around the world.

I enjoy working on challenging problems that require me to think outside the box, and exploring new frontiers in technology.
This is also reflected in my hobbies, which include
learning new [skills](cv/skills) and [languages](cv/skills.md#languages), automating processes, hiking, and stargazing.
