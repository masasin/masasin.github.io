# About me

![Jean Nassar (Obligatory photo)](/assets/images/jean.png){: style="width:200px;border-radius: 50%", align="left"}

Hello! I'm Jean Nassar, and I'm a senior Python and robotics expert with more than 10 years of multidisciplinary experience.

I am currently looking for a [new full-time opportunity](#hire-me) in Belgium starting from 1 September 2023.

I have been living in Belgium since 2018, and have worked in multiple fields,
including [industrial automation](cv/work.md#industrial-automation-engineer-kapernikov),
[data science](cv/work.md#senior-python-developer-yieldsio), and [web development](cv/work.md#senior-software-engineer-adimian).

As a senior engineer of almost 4 years,
I have [mentored colleagues](cv/mentoring.md) in software development best practices and nurtured their Python skills.
I have received praise for my patience and ability to explain complex topics effectively.

I completed my [Masters program](cv/education/kyoto.md) with the
[Mechatronics lab]{{ urls.edu.matsuno }} at Kyoto University in Japan.
There, I focused on [human-robot interaction](cv/projects.md),
with projects such as:

- [Spirit](cv/projects/spirit.md), a third-person view for monocular drones
- [Yozakura](cv/projects/yozakura.md), a teleoperated robot for the Rescue League at the RoboCup Japan Open
- [Gestural Control of Robots](cv/projects/myo.md), infrastructure for controlling robots with gestures and other modalities


I did my [Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Honours Mechatronics Engineering](cv/education/waterloo.md)
at the University of Waterloo in Canada, including [six co-operative education terms](cv/work/coop.md) at various companies around the world.

I enjoy working on challenging problems that require me to think outside the box, and exploring new frontiers in technology.
This is also reflected in my hobbies, which include
learning new [skills](cv/skills.md) and [languages](cv/skills.md#languages), automating processes, hiking, and stargazing.

Please see [my CV](cv.md) or my [PDF résumé]{{ urls.cv.pdf }} for more details about my experience.
