# About me

Hello! I'm Jean Nassar, and I'm a seasoned Python and robotics expert with a passion for tackling challenging problems
and exploring new frontiers in technology.

I bring to the table seven enriching years of industry experience that spans across continents and disciplines.
My professional journey started with a [Bachelors degree in Honours Mechatronics Engineering](cv/education/waterloo)
at the University of Waterloo.
As a student there, I also did [six co-op terms](cv/work/coop) at various companies around the world.
I then further honed my expertise by completing a [Masters program](cv/education/kyoto) with the
[Mechatronics lab](http://www.mechatronics.me.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.php?ml_lang=en) at Kyoto University.
Since graduating, I have been mainly living in Belgium. I [worked](cv/work) primarily as a software engineer,
though I did do some mechatronics work as well.

I am also a [private tutor](cv/teaching) for many subjects, including Python, robotics, prompt engineering, and Japanese.

I enjoy working on challenging problems that require me to think outside the box.
This is also reflected in my hobbies, which include
[learning languages](cv/languages), automating things around me, hiking, exploration, and learning many new [skills](cv/skills).

I am currently looking for a new challenge.
As a holder of the EU Blue Card, I'm equipped to embark on new professional endeavours
immediately upon fulfillment of employment and visa prerequisites.
