During my academic and professional career, I've been involved in a wide range of projects,
showcasing my versatility and capacity for innovation.
Below is a selection of some of the most significant projects I've worked on.

## [[kyoto#highlighted-projects|Robotics projects]]

Highlighted robotics projects from my time at Kyoto University include:

### [[spirit|SPIRIT]]

_2015 &ndash; 2017_

- Masters thesis project at Kyoto University, developing a third-person view interface for controlling a monocular drone.
- Created a system that superimposed a CGI version of the drone on top of an actual image taken by the FPV camera earlier.
- Designed, conducted, and analyzed user studies which were performed to test the efficacy of the system,
  which showed a large improvement in many metrics, even with a 2 Hz transmission rate.

### [[yozakura|Yozakura]]

_2014 &ndash; 2015_

- Led the software development team for the Yozakura teleoperated rescue robot at Kyoto University's Mechatronics Lab.
- Developed a client-server system for robot control and wrote code for onboard Raspberry Pi and mbed chips,
  including drivers for various controllers and sensors.
- The code was robust against failure and well-documented, providing useful error messages for hardware, software,
  and operator errors of various types, and correcting them where necessary.

### [[myo|Gestural control of robots]]

_2014 &ndash; 2015_

- Initial research project at Kyoto University aimed at developing infrastructure to allow ergonomic control of robots using gestures.
- Designed and developed infrastructure that abstracted away the interface used by using an API,
  with a proof of concept using the Myo armband from Thalmic Labs to control robots.

## [[open_source|Open source projects]]

_2008 &ndash; Present_

- Two packages on PyPI, including [latexipy]{{ urls.projects.latexipy }} (129 stars) for exporting Matplotlib-based plots into native LaTeX.
- Many repositories on GitHub, including [my resume generator]{{ urls.projects.resume }} (118 stars),
  as well as the [2021]{{ urls.projects.aoc2021 }} and [2022]{{ urls.projects.aoc2022 }} Advent of Code repositories.
- Contributions to major and minor open source projects, including numpy, ROS, and more.

## [[undergrad|University of Waterloo projects]]
