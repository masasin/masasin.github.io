# Open Source Project Sampling
_2008 &ndash; Present_

???+ summary

    - Contributed to numerous open source projects, from creating Python libraries to [contributing to projects](#highlighted-pull-requests) large and small.
    - [Projects on PyPI](#projects-on-pypi) include "latexipy," which easily generates great plots in multiple formats, and "pyrosbag,"
      which allows programmatic playback of ROS Bag files.
    - [Highlighted projects](#highlighted-projects) include "spirit," a repository containing masters research code, data analysis, and thesis.
    - Find me on [GitHub.com/masasin]{{ urls.social.github }}.

Most of my code is fully documented.
PyPI projects are on a continuous integration server and have full test coverage as well.
The documentation for some projects is available on [readthedocs.org]{{ urls.projects.rtd }}.
