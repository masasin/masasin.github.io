# Open Source Project Sampling
2008 &ndash; Present

??? summary

    - Contributed to numerous open source projects, from creating Python libraries to contributing to larger projects.
    - Projects on PyPI include "latexipy," which easily generates great plots in multiple formats, and "pyrosbag,"
      which allows programmatic playback of ROS Bag files.
    - Highlighted projects include "resume," a CV and cover letter generator,
      and "spirit," a repository containing masters research code, data analysis, and thesis.

Most of my code is fully documented.
PyPI projects are on a continuous integration server and have full test coverage as well.
The documentation for some projects is available on [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/).
