# Projects
Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects.

A summary of the projects during my education can be found under the respective sections of
my [University of Waterloo](../education/uwaterloo.md#highlighted-projects) and
[Kyoto University](../education/kyoto-u.md#highlighted-projects) education pages.

Since graduating, most of my public projects have been related to [open-source projects](open_source.md).

Highlighted projects from Kyoto University include:

- [SPIRIT](spirit.md): A system for teleoperating drones in degraded environments.
- [Yozakura](yozakura.md): A teleoperated rescue robot for use in disaster scenarios.
- [Gestural control of robots](myo.md): A system for controlling robots using gestures.

Details of my projects during my time at the University of Waterloo can be found at the [undergraduate projects](undergrad.md) page.
