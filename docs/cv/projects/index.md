# Projects
During my academic and professional career, I've been involved in a wide range of projects,
showcasing my versatility and capacity for innovation.
Below is a selection of some of the most significant projects I've worked on.

A summary of the projects during my education can be found under the respective sections of
my [University of Waterloo](../education/uwaterloo.md#highlighted-projects) and
[Kyoto University](../education/kyoto-u.md#highlighted-projects) pages.

Since graduating, most of my public projects have been related to [open-source projects](open_source.md).

Highlighted projects from Kyoto University include:

- [SPIRIT](spirit.md): Developed a novel third-person view interface for drone control in degraded environments as part of my Masters thesis.
- [Yozakura](yozakura.md): Was the lead software developer for the Yozakura teleoperated rescue robot, designed for use in disaster scenarios.
- [Gestural control of robots](myo.md): Pioneered a project at Kyoto University to develop ergonomic controls for robots
  using gesture-based interfaces.

Details of my projects during my time at the University of Waterloo can be found at the [undergraduate projects](undergrad.md) page.

[full-time employment](../work_experience).
