During my academic and professional career, I've been involved in a wide range of projects,
showcasing my versatility and capacity for innovation.
Below is a selection of some of the most significant projects I've worked on.

## [Open source projects](open_source)
_2008 &ndash; Present_

- Contributed to numerous open source projects, from creating Python libraries to contributing to projects large and small.
- Projects on PyPI include "latexipy," which easily generates great plots in multiple formats, and "pyrosbag,"
  which allows programmatic playback of ROS Bag files.

## Kyoto University projects
Highlighted projects from Kyoto University include:

### [SPIRIT](spirit)
_2015 &ndash; 2017_

- Masters thesis project at Kyoto University, developing a third-person view interface for controlling a monocular drone.
- Created a system that superimposed a CGI version of the drone on top of an actual image taken by the FPV camera earlier.
- Designed, conducted, and analyzed user studies which were performed to test the efficacy of the system,
  which showed a large improvement in many metrics, even with a 2 Hz transmission rate.

### [Yozakura](yozakura)
_2014 &ndash; 2015_

- Led the software development team for the Yozakura teleoperated rescue robot at Kyoto University's Mechatronics Lab.
- Developed a client-server system for robot control and wrote code for onboard Raspberry Pi and mbed chips,
including drivers for various controllers and sensors.
- The code was robust against failure and well-documented, providing useful error messages for hardware, software,
and operator errors of various types, and correcting them where necessary.

### [Gestural control of robots](myo)
_2014 &ndash; 2015_

- Initial research project at Kyoto University aimed at developing infrastructure to allow ergonomic control of robots using gestures.
- Designed and developed infrastructure that abstracted away the interface used by using an API,
  with a proof of concept using the Myo armband from Thalmic Labs to control robots.
  
## University of Waterloo projects
_2008 &ndash; 2013_

Details of my projects during my time at the University of Waterloo can be found at the [undergraduate projects](undergrad.md) page.
