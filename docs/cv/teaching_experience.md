# Teaching experience
## Private tutor
I started tutoring in middle school, when I helped a neighbour pass his national exam.

In 2017, after obtaining my Masters degree, I tutored people around Edmonton, AB, Canada in Python. Specifically, I taught skills that helped them in their own projects.

In one case, I started by automating one report of a financial analyst working for a grocery store chain, allowing him to start learning Python on the job. I also automated one of his side jobs, giving him more disposable income. He has since automated many more of his tasks, and has been providing completely new insights to his company. This has earned him a promotion and a sponsored masters degree. I still provide support as necessary.

In another, I enabled a PhD student to analyze his electron-phase micrographs by writing software with them which did the job of commercial software with an expensive license. I was acknowledged by name in [his paper](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5028398?class=pdf).

Since 2019, I have also been teaching Python and Japanese both locally and on [Apprentus](https://apprentus.com), an online lesson platform.
