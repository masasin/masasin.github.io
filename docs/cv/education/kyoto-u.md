# Kyoto University
I was a member of the [Mechatronics Laboratory](http://www.mechatronics.me.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.php?ml_lang=en) at Kyoto University from 2014 to 2017.
I joined as a research student in 2013, and enrolled in the Masters program starting in April 2014.
I graduated in March 2017 with a Master of Engineering degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

While at Kyoto University, I worked on many projects.
My research topics were primarily on the topic of [human-robot interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93robot_interaction).
I started out working on the [gestural control of robots](../projects/myo),
and switched to [teleoperation of drones](../projects/spirit) in my second year.

At Kyoto University, I also [tutored other students](../teaching_experience) in Python and software development best practices,
including testing and version control.
I also participated in the [RoboCup Japan Open Rescue League](yozakura.md) multiple times in the teleoperated division.
At the 2015 OpenHackDay hackathon, which was held over two days at the Yahoo Japan headquarters in Tokyo,
my team and I made a suitcase which follows its owner over various terrains.

Finally, I also participated in the 2016 edition in [Japan Tent](https://www.japantent.com/english.html)
(link not accessible from the EU), a program by Ishikawa Prefecture which allows foreign students from across Japan
to stay with two families in the region.
I was selected as a Japan Tent ambassador for the year thanks to my Japanese ability.
