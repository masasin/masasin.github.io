# University of Waterloo
I completed [six co-operative education (co-op) internships](../work_experience/coop)
in three countries over a total of two years.
Each co-op is normally a four-month-long remunerated full-time position,
which allows a student to experience various facets of engineering.

I also participated heavily in club activities.
For example, I was an active member of the [Konnichiwa Japan club](https://www.uwkonja.com/about.html) between 2010 and 2013,
including one term as secretary.
I was involved in recruiting new members, and handled internal and external club communications.

In 2010, I was also the secretary of the [Club for Undergraduate Bioengineers (CUBE)](http://cube.uwaterloo.ca/index.php),
and helped organize the [4th International Symposium on Health Technology](http://cube.uwaterloo.ca/Symposium%202010%20web%20site/symp%202010.htm).
That included finding speakers, inviting them to come, following up with people who did not reply or submit papers,
and arranging accommodation for the speakers coming in from outside of Waterloo.

In 2012, I directed the University of Waterloo Engineering Society (EngSoc) mental health directorship.
As director, I introduced a successful initiative to bring service animals on campus during exams to help reduce student stress.
This was eventually emulated beyond the faculty of engineering.

Also in 2012, I co-founded the [Engineering Student Ambassador program](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering-student-ambassadors/),
which encourages current engineering students to help give prospective students a personal and informative connection to the faculty of engineering.
The program is still active.

In 2012 and 2013, I was shadowed by two international exchange students as part of the [Waterloo Engineering Shadow program](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering-student-ambassadors/shadow-program)
(now part of the Student Ambassador program), and helped them integrate into Canada and the university.
I also taught beginner and intermediate Japanese courses as a volunteer
with the [University of Waterloo Culture and Language Exchange Club (UWCLEC)](https://uwclec.webs.com/).
