# Curriculum Vitae
???+ summary

    - I [studied](#education) Mechatronics Engineering at the [University of Waterloo](education/waterloo.md),
      and did my masters at [Kyoto University](education/kyoto.md).
    - Since graduation, I have [worked](#work-experience) primarily in a software engineering role, with a focus on Python and some robotics.
      I have worked in a variety of fields, including [industrial automation](work/kapernikov.md),
      [data science](work/yields.md), and [web development](work/adimian.md).
    - I have worked on many [projects](#project-sampling), including [open source projects](projects/open_source)
      as well as projects from the [University of Waterloo](projects/undergrad) and [Kyoto University](projects/index.md#kyoto-university-projects).
    - I have over twenty years experience in [tutoring others](#teaching-experience) in various subjects,
      mentoring peers, and helping people with problems in general.
    - I speak many [languages](#languages), including English, French, and Dutch, Japanese.

As a Python and robotics expert, I work precisely with an eye for detail and a dedication to safety.
My primary focus is software engineering and interfacing with hardware,
but I am also strong in mechanical and system design,
data science, and visualization.

I have a multidisciplinary perspective, having worked in many fields in five countries, and in many languages.
I can easily adapt to changing environments.
I continue to learn, and always strive to improve.
