- Worked on automatically migrating and testing client code and artifacts with version increases, and deprecated old features.
- Moved integration tests away from depending on mocks into tests that worked with a deployed Docker environment.

## [Industrial Automation Engineer](kapernikov), Kapernikov
_March to October 2019, Brussels, Belgium (hybrid)._

- Developed a monitoring system for a conveyor belt using Python 3 and ROS.
- Used a laser profiler and camera for object identification and created a 3D representation of the conveyor belt.
- Detected potentially disruptive objects in real time and produced visualizations for the client’s video management system.
- Fixed bugs in C++ code and created a standalone ROS node for camera communication.

## [Data Scientist](sentiance), Sentiance
_February to December 2018, Antwerp, Belgium (hybrid)._

- Moved the company’s codebase from Python 2 to Python 3.
- Refactored core functionality into more modular components
- Verified and built machine learning models in numpy and scikit-learn.
