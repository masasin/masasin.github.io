- Served as the primary Python developer, working on the core of the platform.
- Refactored and stabilized the codebase, added tests, fixed bugs, and developed new features.
- Worked on automatically migrating and testing client code and artifacts with version increases, and deprecated old features.
- Moved integration tests away from depending on mocks into tests that worked with a deployed Docker environment.

## Industrial Automation Engineer, [Kapernikov](kapernikov)
_March to October 2019, Brussels, Belgium._

- Developed a monitoring system for a conveyor belt using Python 3 and ROS.
- Used a laser profiler and camera for object identification and created a 3D representation of the conveyor belt.
- Detected potentially disruptive objects in real time and produced visualizations for the client’s video management system.
- Fixed bugs in C++ code and created a standalone ROS node for camera communication.

## Data Scientist, [Sentiance](sentiance)
_February to December 2018, Antwerp, Belgium._

- Moved the company’s codebase from Python 2 to Python 3.
- Refactored core functionality into more modular components, verified and built machine learning models in numpy and scikit-learn.
