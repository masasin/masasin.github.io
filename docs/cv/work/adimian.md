Working on both internal Adimian products and external projects, I was involved in the complete iterative process,
going from the initial analysis and design, to development and finally deployment and evolutive maintenance.
All Python code was developed using TDD with pytest.

I started with a small project within Adimian, where I had my first exposure to web development using FastAPI and VueJS.
I then developed an SVG schematic generation tool for a photonics company,
and went on to develop another tool which allowed the user to view and navigate said schematics.

I also worked on a governance voting tool used by various energy transmission system operators (TSOs) all over Europe.
The tool had been developed by Adimian using FastAPI, Vue, and VueX,
and I provided critical support by solving bugs and developing new features at the request of the client.

I was dispatched to a Regional Coordination Centre for European TSOs in April 2022.
My role entailed end-to-end project responsibility, ranging from initial design to final completion,
followed by proactive and responsive maintenance.

Our workflow consisted of biweekly sprints, where I did code development and documentation, as well as reviewing and testing code written by my coworkers.
The technology stack primarily included Python, where I utilized libraries such as
Pydantic, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Redis for backend development; and Vue for frontend tasks.
In some cases, I designed and implemented ad-hoc scripts, managed releases, and efficiently addressed bug reports,
maintaining the high standard of our deliverables.

In addition to project work, I also took a mentorship role.
I leveraged my tutoring experience and technical knowledge to help colleagues improve their skills and on-boarded new team members,
guiding their integration into our dynamic working environment.
I introduced new techniques and methodologies, and participated in [CodeBar](https://codebar.io/workshops/2547) as a teacher.

I was highly praised for my patience and understanding when reviewing, explaining, or mentoring, as well as the speed and quality of my own code.
