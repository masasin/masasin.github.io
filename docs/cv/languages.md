# Languages
Learning languages is a hobby of mine,
so I'm always learning new ones.
I have accumulated quite a few over the years.

- **English:** Native. English education.
- **French:** Native.
- **Dutch:** Intermediate. Passed up to CVO 2.3/2.4 mondeling.
- **Japanese:** Excellent. Masters done entirely in Japanese, except for my thesis.
- **Arabic:** Excellent.
- **Lebanese:** Native.
- **Spanish:** Conversational.

The rest of these languages are at a beginner level.
I am currently improving at some:

- **German:** Can read easy books and listen to some podcasts etc.
- **Italian:** Can read recipes and understand some videos etc.

While others are on pause:

- Hebrew
- Korean
- Mandarin
- Russian
