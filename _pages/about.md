title: About me
---

As a Python and robotics expert, I work precisely with an eye for detail and a dedication to safety.
My primary focus is software engineering and interfacing with hardware,
but I am also strong in data science and visualization, as well as in mechanical and system design.
I have a multidisciplinary perspective, having worked in many fields in five countries, and in many languages.
I can easily adapt to changing environments. I continue to learn, and always strive to improve.
