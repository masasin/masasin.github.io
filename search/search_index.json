Inspection of collapsed structures paves the way for a safer search and rescue operation in the aftermath. Using drones is tight spaces is difficult, and the boundaries of the drone are not visible in the first-person view (FPV) feed, especially with a monocular camera. In addition, signal quality may be degraded due to structural materials, leading to a bad or spotty connection.</p> <p>Building upon previous work of the Mechatronics lab on the use of Past Image Records for teleoperation, mobile manipulators, and narrow communication bands, I created a third-person view interface for controlling an AR.Drone, primarily using Python and ROS.

Their core product, NephroFlow, is a mature and comprehensive dialysis management platform used by clinicians to digitize and manage the entire workflow of dialysis treatment. The application operates within the highly regulated European medical software landscape, and is used by dialysis centres around the world. I worked on the web application component, which is built with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.</p> <p>As a senior software developer on one of the core product teams, I was responsible for the full lifecycle of several new features, from technical analysis and design to implementation and release. My work involved developing new capabilities for the NephroFlow platform, improving existing functionality, and tackling complex technical challenges.</p> <p>I took end-to-end ownership of several technically demanding platform features. One such project was the implementation of a dynamic unit conversion system. Previously, users had to manually convert measurement values (e.g., blood glucose levels) before entry, leading to potential errors. I designed and built a system that allowed users to select the input unit directly in the interface, which then handled the conversion and storage automatically, improving both usability and data integrity. I also engineered the platform's OIDC and LDAP integration from the ground up, delivering a critical feature for enterprise clients requiring robust, modern authentication solutions.</p> <p>My role also involved significant work in the application's data-intensive environment. I engineered the automation of complex regulatory reports for Belgian authorities (e.g., RIZIV/INAMI), which replaced a time-consuming manual process. This required careful handling of numerous edge cases and inconsistencies within large sets of production hospital data. I also extended the platform's interoperability by implementing the ingestion of inbound HL7 messages (such as ADT) for automatic patient record updates, and the production of outbound messages to ensure data synchronization with hospital-wide information systems. Additionally, I contributed to the modernization of the platform's analytics capabilities by implementing the foundational backend architecture for a new statistics dashboard, which uses Cube.js to provide new visualizations and insights based on existing dbt data models.</p> <p>In addition to my technical duties, I served as a crucial cultural and technical bridge for collaboration. When a delegation from a Japanese partner company visited to explore market expansion opportunities, I supported this initiative on multiple fronts. Technically, I directly mentored an engineer embedded in our team, guiding them on the specifics of our Ruby application and development practices. To make them feel welcome, I also acted as a cultural host; for instance, my wife and I gave some members of the delegation a tour of Bruges, a gesture that they greatly appreciated.</p>"},{"location":"cv/work/sentiance/","title":"Data Scientist, Sentiance","text":"<p>February \u2013 December 2018, Antwerp, Belgium (hybrid)</p> Summary <ul> <li>Moved the company\u2019s codebase from Python 2 to Python 3.</li> <li>Refactored core functionality into more modular components</li> <li>Verified and built machine learning models in numpy and scikit-learn.</li> <li>Used pyspark to increase code efficiency by parallelizing, or to add new functionality.</li> <li>Created several docker containers and docker-compose files to automate environment setup and teardown.</li> <li>Worked on standardizing DevPI index contents using Pipenv.</li> </ul> <p> Sentiance turns IOT sensor data from e.g., mobile phones into insightful data, such as the segment of the population that a user belongs to, as well as their current actions and predicted future actions.
